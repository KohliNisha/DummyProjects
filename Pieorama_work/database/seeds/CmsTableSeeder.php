            'content' => "<p>Thank you for trusting us with your information. We value that trust reposed in us, and that&rsquo;s why protecting your information, and being clear about how we collect, use, exchange and protect your information, is of huge importance and a vital part of our relationship with you.<br />
<b>1. Your privacy is important to us</b><br />
This Policy outlines how Plendify and its related companies, (&ldquo;we / us / the Group&rdquo;) collect, disclose, use, store or otherwise handle personal information. It is important to us that we manage your personal information securely and consistently with relevant legislation, including the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) (&ldquo;Privacy Act&rdquo;) as well as the Credit Reporting Privacy Code (where applicable).<br />
This Policy explains:<br />
The kinds of personal information (including credit-related information) we collect;<br />
The purposes for which we collect this information;<br />
How we manage the personal information that we collect about you;<br />
How you can seek access to and correction of that information;<br />
If necessary, how you can make a complaint relating to our handling of that information.<br />
This policy is not limited to current customers or guarantors of customers (where applicable) &ndash; it relates to all other individuals who deal with us, whether in relation to the provision of credit or otherwise.<br />
<b>2. Information we collect from you</b><br />
We collect information about you and your interactions with us, for example, when you request or use our products or services, make a card purchase or transfer money, phone us or visit any of our websites. When you use our website or mobile applications, we may collect information about your location or activity including IP address, telephone number and whether you&rsquo;ve accessed third-party sites. Some of this website information we collect using cookies.<br />
The information we collect from you may include your identity and contact details, other personal details such as gender and marital status and financial information. Where applicable, we also collect health information, for example, for insurance purposes.<br />
<b>2.1 Personal Information</b><br />
We will collect certain information about you depending on the circumstances in which the product or service is being provided. This information can include:<br />
Key personal information such as your name, residential and business addresses, telephone numbers, email and other electronic addresses;<br />
Financial and related information, such as your occupation, accounts, bank account information (from prior to the loan being granted and ongoing for the term of the loan), assets, expenses, income, revenue, dependents, and regarding your employment, financial and business dealings and other relevant events;

<p>Your transaction history (with us and our associates or relevant third parties). This information includes products you may have used with us in the past, your payment history, and the capacity in which you have dealt or deal with us;<br />
Other relevant information &ndash; depending on the circumstances this may also include health and medical information, membership of professional bodies, tax file number information and other government identifiers (e.g. if relevant to identifying you).<br />
<b>2.2 Information we collect from others</b><br />
We collect information about you from others such as service providers, agents, your bank, advisers, brokers, employers or family members. For example, if you apply for credit, we may need to obtain a credit report from a credit reporting body. We will also obtain bank account information from your bank throughout the term of the loan. We may collect information about you that is publicly available, for example, from public registers or social media, or made available by third parties.<br />
<b>2.3 Sensitive information</b><br />
The Privacy Act also protects your sensitive information, such as health information that&rsquo;s collected on insurance or hardship applications. If we need to obtain this type of information, we will ask for your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law.<br />
<b>3. How do we use your information?</b><br />
In many circumstances, we will collect the above information primarily from you (or from someone who is representing or assisting you). However, there are certain instances in which we will collect information about you from third parties where it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect it directly from you. For example, even where your application is for credit, we may collect information about you from a business which provides information about commercial credit worthiness for the purpose of assessing your application. We use this information to:<br />
Establish your identity and assess applications for products and services<br />
Price and design our products and services<br />
Administer our products and services<br />
Manage our relationship with you<br />
Conduct and improve our businesses and improve the customer experience<br />
Manage our risks and help identify and investigate illegal activity, such as fraud<br />
Contact you, for example if we suspect fraud on your account or need to tell you something important<br />
Comply with our legal obligations and assist government and law enforcement agencies or regulators<br />
Identify and tell you about other products or services that we think may be of interest to you.<br />
We may also collect, use and exchange your information in other ways where permitted by law.<br />
<b>3.1 Direct marketing</b><br />
If you don&rsquo;t want to receive direct marketing, you can tell us by using any of the methods set out in section 9.<br />
<b>3.2 Gathering and combining data to get insights</b><br />
Improvements in technology enable organisations to collect and use information to get a more integrated view of customers and provide better products and services. We may combine customer information with information available from a wide variety of external sources (for example census or Australian Bureau of Statistics data). We are able to analyse the data in order to gain useful insights which can be used for any of the purposes mentioned earlier in this policy. In addition, Group members may provide data insights or related reports to others, for example to help them understand their customers better. These are based on aggregated information and do not contain any information that identifies you.<br />
<b>4. Who do we exchange your information with?</b><br />
We exchange your information with other members of the Group, so that the Group may adopt an integrated approach to its customers. Group members may use this information for any of the purposes mentioned in this section.<br />
<b>4.1 Third parties</b><br />
We may exchange your information with third parties where this is permitted by law or for any of the purposes mentioned in section 4. Third parties include:<br />
Your co-applicant(s) (if any)<br />
Related entities based in Australia or overseas<br />
Entities that provide services to us such as mailing houses or call centre operators<br />
Service providers, for example law firms, market research / data providers, and loyalty program redemption partners<br />

Credit reporting bodies and credit providers<br />
Entities established to help identify illegal activities and prevent fraud<br />
Overseas entities that provide products and services to us.<br />
<b>4.2 Sending information overseas</b><br />

Generally, we use customer service teams located within Ghana. However we may send your information overseas, including to overseas Group members and to service providers or other third parties who operate or hold data outside Ghana. Where we do this, we make sure that appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place. Please note that Ghanaian law may not apply to some of these entities.<br />
We may also send information overseas to complete a particular transaction or where this is required by laws and regulations of Ghana or another country.<br />
Where we send your information overseas, it is likely to be one of the following countries:<br />
Canada<br />
Where we send your information to overseas Group members or service providers, we make sure that appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place.<br />
<b>5. Credit checks and credit reporting</b><br />
When you apply to us for credit or propose to be a guarantor, we need to know if you&rsquo;re able to meet repayments under your agreement with us. We also want to avoid giving you further credit if this would put you in financial difficulty. One of our checks involves obtaining a credit report about you.<br />

<b>5.1 Credit reports</b><br />
A credit report contains information about your credit history that helps credit providers assess your credit applications, verify your identity and manage accounts you hold with them. Credit reporting bodies collect and exchange this information with credit providers like us and other service providers such as phone companies.<br />
The Privacy Act limits the information that credit providers can disclose about you to credit reporting bodies, as well as the ways in which credit providers can use credit reports.<br />
<b>5.2 What information can we exchange with credit reporting bodies?</b><br />
The information we can exchange includes:<br />
Your identification details<br />
What type of loans you have<br />
How much you&rsquo;ve borrowed<br />
Whether or not you&rsquo;ve met your loan payment obligations<br />
If you have committed a serious credit infringement (such as fraud).<br />
We also ask the credit reporting body to provide us with an overall assessment score of your creditworthiness.<br />
The credit reporting bodies we use are Equifax Inc, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd. You can access a copy of their respective privacy policies at:<br />

<b>5.3 What do we do with credit-related information?</b><br />
We use information from credit reporting bodies to confirm your identity, assess applications for credit, manage our relationship with you and collect overdue payments. We also use this information as part of arriving at our own internal assessment of your creditworthiness.<br />
We store credit-related information with your other information. You can access credit-related information we hold about you, request us to correct the information and make a complaint to us about your credit-related information. See sections 8 and 9.<br />

<b>5.4 Other rights you have</b><br />
Credit providers may ask credit-reporting bodies to use their credit-related information to pre-screen you for direct marketing. You can ask a credit reporting body not to do this. Also, if you&rsquo;ve been, or have reason to believe that you&rsquo;re likely to become, a victim of fraud (including identity fraud), you can ask the credit reporting body not to use or disclose the credit-related information it holds about you.<br />
<b>6. Keeping your information secure</b><br />

<b>6.1 Staff education</b><br />

You are advised to keep your log-in details private and confidential. Your log-in details are your responsibility and we advise you not to share those details with any party.
